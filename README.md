## Description  

In this assessment, you are expected to use the bouncing balls demo from the previous article as a starting point, and add some new and interesting features to it.

### Project brief

Our bouncy ball demo is fun, but now we want to make it a little bit more interactive by adding a user-controlled evil circle, which will eat the balls if it catches them. We also want to test your object-building skills by creating a generic Shape() object that our balls and evil circle can inherit from. Finally, we want to add a score counter to track the number of balls left to capture.
